        <h3>Quantifying Economic Damages from Climate Change Using Conditional Diffusion-Based Projections</h3>
        <p class="meta"> with Sandeep Juneja, Manmeet Singh, Dhruman Gupta</p>
        <p>
            This paper develops a conditional diffusion
            modeling framework to produce probabilistic projections of
            climate variables that are consistent with both historical
            observations and future scenarios from empircally validated climate
            models for India. Using these projections, we estimate the economic
            damages from climate change for India under various emission
            scenarios.

        <h3>Market Power and Core Inflation: Evidence from India</h3>
        <p class="meta">With Kiriti Kanjilal</p>
        <p>Firm pricing behavior can have major macroeconomic implications, including high inflation. We leverage firm-level balance sheets and granular core inflation data to study the relationship between profitability metrics such as markup and market power of firms and core inflation in India. We map each firm to the sectoral core inflation component. We don't find any evidence of firm market power in amplifying core inflation. We do, however, observe a negative relationship between markups and core inflation, which echoes the theoretical relationship in the New Keynesian Literature. This study explores several other relationships involving markups, which have significant macroeconomic implications.</p>

        <h3>Anomaly Boosting: A deep learning approach</h3>
        <p class="meta">with Sandeep Juneja, Nagpurnanand Prabhala, Aman Foujdar, Sidharth Wagle</p>
        <p>The explanatory power of Fama-French factors in capturing stock returns variation is well established in the literature. Furthermore, recent advances in deep learning techniques for time-series forecasting have outperformed regression-based models on a variety of datasets. 
    In this paper, we construct factors related to Indian equity markets leveraging annual firm balance-sheet and daily stock level data. In addition, we propose a novel approach to portfolio optimization by training a deep learning model using Fama-French factors. We select the top 300 firms on the basis of market capitalization and build a long-short trading strategy where the portfolio is rebalanced every month. Our trading strategy generates an economically significant alpha and is easily implementable in practice. </p>
